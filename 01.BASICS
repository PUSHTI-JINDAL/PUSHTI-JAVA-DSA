Welcome to my personal Java DSA repository!  
I'm learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and uploading my daily progress here — step-by-step with code and explanations.

## ✅ What I’ve Already Covered (Before Starting This Repo):

- Java Basics (input/output, loops, conditionals)
- Functions and methods
- Arrays (1D)
- Linear Search
- Time and space complexity basics

> I’ve already completed these topics but didn’t upload them. I'm now starting from **Binary Search** and will keep uploading consistently as I move forward.
