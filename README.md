Welcome to my personal Java DSA repository!  
I'm learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and uploading my daily progress here â€” step-by-step with code and explanations.

âœ… What Iâ€™ve Already Covered (Before Starting This Repo):

- Java Basics (input/output, loops, conditionals)
- Functions and methods
- Arrays (1D)
- Linear Search
- Time and space complexity basics

> Iâ€™ve already completed these topics but didnâ€™t upload them. I'm now starting from **Binary Search** and will keep uploading consistently as I move forward.

# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my Java solutions while learning DSA.

## Note:
The first two programs (`BinarySearch.java`, `Ceiling.java`) were initially copy-pasted directly into GitHub.

Later, I learned how to properly push code using Git and IntelliJ.  
Now, I have organized my files and push everything directly from my local system.

## Structure:
- `src/searching02/Floor.java` â€“ First properly pushed file.
- More files coming as I learn each concept step-by-step.

## Goal:
To master Java DSA and maintain a clean, structured GitHub journey. ðŸš€
